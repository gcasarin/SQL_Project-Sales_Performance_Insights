### Project Overview

This is an Advanced Data Analytics project that leverages sophisticated SQL techniques to answer specific business questions.
It focuses on solving real-world business challenges by writing complex SQL queries, which include the extensive use of Advanced Window Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Subqueries.

The project follows a comprehensive roadmap and involves executing several key analysis types:

- **Change Over Time Analysis**: To track trends and identify data seasonality.
- **Cumulative Analysis**: To progressively aggregate data over time, enabling us to understand the business's overall growth or decline trajectory (i.e., running totals).
- **Performance Analysis**: To benchmark current values against a target or historical standard (e.g., comparing current sales against the product's average or the previous year's sales).
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis**: To determine the proportional contribution of a segment to the total (e.g., calculating the percentage contribution of a specific category to overall sales).
- **Data Segmentation**: To group data into specific, meaningful ranges, thereby creating new dimensions for analysis (e.g., segmenting products by cost brackets or customers by their spending behavior)."
